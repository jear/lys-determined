"""
This example shows how to use Determined to implement an image
classification model for the Fashion-MNIST dataset using tf.keras.

Based on: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification.

After about 5 training epochs, accuracy should be around > 85%.
This mimics theoriginal implementation. Continue training or increase
the number of epochs to increase accuracy.
